# CH32V003-BaseBootloader
Dump of the base bootloader shipped together with CH32V003

The dump comes from the first 1920 (0x780) bytes of the System Memory of a CH32V003F4U6.
It should be compatible with all the CH32V003 series.

This can be uploaded on the boot memory using WCH-LinkUtility and setting the memory address where to upload the firmware to 0x1FFFF000.
